    "description": "The <strong>Milling head V2<\/strong> features a 200W Brushless Milling motor. It's capable of reaching 14000 RPM but it's quieter and more balanced than the Hybrid Head. The Milling Head V2 supports milling bits with a shank diameter in the range of 3.0 to 3.5mm (0.12 inches or 1\/8).<br> The Standard ER8 Collet can be swapped with another compatible to this industry standard so it can be equipped with endbits with shank diameter from 0.1 to 6mm",
