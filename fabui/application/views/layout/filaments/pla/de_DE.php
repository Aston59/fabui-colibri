	It is the most common filament used for 3D printing.<br> It is studied
	to be bio-degradable as it comes from corn starch's sugar mainly.<br>
	It is completely made of renewable sources and has no footprint on
	polluting.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>PLA</strong> stands for PolyLactic Acid and it is a thermoplastic that today is
	still considered the easiest material to be 3D printed. <br>It can be
	extruded at lower temperatures: the standard range of FABtotum's one is
	between <strong>185&deg;</strong> and <strong>195&deg;</strong>.
</p>
<p>Its major technical specs are:</p>
<ul >
	<li>it is hard and resists at high pressures but it is easy to chip and
		break if hit;</li>
	<li>it is easy to extrude at lower temperatures and it deforms at 60&deg;
	<li>it cristalyze fast.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
<p>PLA filament must be well stored and kept safe from humidity. Once
	the package is open, add some silica dehumidifier inside; add a smooth
	layer of hairspray on your heated bed.<br> Keep the fan of the Printing
	Head on; always unspool it from the 3D printer to avoid it to
	cristalyze inside the head; always use high quality filaments like
	FABtotum's ones.</p>
