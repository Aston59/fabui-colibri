<p>This material is easy to be extruded and is one of the most used in
	3D printing to get very well finished objects.<br>It is not suistainable
	and its smoke can be dangerous if inhalated. <br>The reason to prefer this
	filament to PLA is mainly because of its precision and mechanical
	specs.</p>
	<p><strong>ABS</strong> (for plastic) stands for Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene and
	it is a thermoplastic which is widely used in everyday objects. <br>It can
	be printed with any FFF 3D printer which can get to high temperatures
	as it must be extruded in a range between <strong>220&deg;</strong> and <strong>245&deg;</strong>, such as
	FABtotum.</p>
<p>Its major technical specs are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>it is very hard and resists more to warps and damages;</li>
	<li>it doesn't deform easily;</li>
	<li>it is longlasting in performance and less subject to deteriorate if
		exposed (to light, humidity and so on).</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Tips</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>ABS filament, when extruded, tends to curl up: use an heated
		platform like FABtotum's Hybrid Bed at least at <strong>60&deg;/70&deg;C</strong> to avoid
		this. Apply a small amount of hairspray to stick the object on the
		surface;</li>
	
	<li>fan should be off to avoid the cold end of the Printing Head to
		warm;</li>
	
	<li>ABS can be smoky and smelly: use it in a well ventilated area/room;</li>
	<li>always choose high quality filaments like FABtotum's ones.</li>

</ul>
